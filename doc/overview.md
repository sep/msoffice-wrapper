This cookbook extends the [msoffice](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/msoffice) cookbook found on the Chef Supermarket. 
The cookbook on the Supermarket only supported installing from an ISO where I needed to install office from an extracted ISO. 

To run this cookbook you should create a folder called C:\Installers\ and extract the Office 2007 iso into it
