# msoffice-wrapper

This cookbook wraps the msoffice community Cookbook. The big difference is the 
community cookbook expects an ISO and this cookbook expects the setup.exe for MS Office 2013 Pro

This was tested on Windows 10 

TODO: contribute to the msoffice cookbook to handle either the path to an ISO or setup.exe
